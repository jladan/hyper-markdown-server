# Hyper Markdown Server

```toml
date = 2023-11-06
tags = ["md-server"]
```

A simple markdown file server written in rust, using the fairly low-level
[hyper](https://crates.io/crates/hyper) library. The intended use is to view
files in my notes directory.

For a guide of how to run the server and use templates, see [usage.md](usage.md).
